# CausalReinforcementNet (CRN)

**Adaptive RL Framework for Cryptocurrency Trading with Causal Feature Engineering and Regime Awareness**

---

##  Overview

CausalReinforcementNet (CRN) is a flexible, modular reinforcement learning framework tailored for cryptocurrency trading. It combines causal feature engineering, regime-aware Bayesian inference, and user-defined risk constraints to generate intelligent, interpretable, and adaptive trading strategies. The framework integrates reinforcement learning agents with Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs) to adjust position sizing and actions based on latent market conditions.

##  Key Features

- **Causal Feature Engineering**: Integrates domain knowledge into feature construction to improve robustness and interpretability.
- **Regime-Aware Trading Logic**: Leverages Dynamic Bayesian Networks to detect market regimes and adjust trading behavior accordingly.
- **Position Sizing Rules**: Applies rule-based logic to adapt trade size based on confidence levels and user-defined thresholds.
- **Modular Reinforcement Learning**: Supports multiple RL algorithms including PPO and DDPG, enabling ablation and benchmarking.
- **Backtest-Ready**: Includes comprehensive evaluation metrics such as ROI, Sharpe Ratio, drawdown, and reward component analysis.
